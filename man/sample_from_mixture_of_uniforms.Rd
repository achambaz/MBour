\title{Samples from a mixture of uniform laws}
\usage{
sample_from_mixture_of_uniforms(n, mixture_weights, mins, maxs)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{An \code{integer}, the sample size.}

\item{mixture_weights}{A  \code{vector} of \code{numerics}  that specifies
the weights given to the uniform laws. Must sum up to one.}

\item{mins}{A  \code{vector}   of  \code{numerics}  that  specifies  the
lower-bounds of the supports of the uniform laws.}

\item{maxs}{A  \code{vector}   of  \code{numerics}  that  specifies  the
upper-bounds of the supports of the uniform laws.}
}
\value{
A \code{vector} of numerics, the sample.
}
\description{
Samples  from the  mixture of  uniform laws  characterized by  the provided
weights and corresponding intervals.
